# hello-world

Hello you all!

I'm just doing the GitHub's guide for whatever reason, I already know this shit lol.
I'm a developer from south of Brazil, for more than 13 years. Usually working with web development, but also with some background on design, communication, advertising, marketing and animation. Just a normal human being as we all.
